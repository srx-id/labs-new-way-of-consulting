# Expected Correlations - Guidance

## Hypotheses to Test

### Price vs. Complaints
- **Direction**: Could be positive or negative
- **Rationale**: More complaints might indicate busy neighborhoods (positive) or poor quality (negative)
- **Confounder**: Population density affects both

### Reviews vs. Temperature
- **Direction**: Likely positive
- **Rationale**: Tourism increases in warmer months
- **Confounder**: School schedules, holidays

### Price vs. Crime
- **Direction**: Likely negative
- **Rationale**: Higher crime may deter guests
- **Confounder**: Borough-level economic factors

## Pearson vs. Spearman

Expect some divergence due to:
- Non-linear relationships (e.g., seasonality)
- Outlier neighborhoods
- Skewed distributions

## Statistical Significance

With 60 observations, correlations > 0.25 typically reach p < 0.05 significance.
